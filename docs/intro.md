- 🛠️ **Model Builder**: Easily create Ollama models. Create and add custom characters/agents, customize chat elements, and import models effortlessly.

- 📚 **Local RAG Integration for Educational Content**  
  Empower learners and educators with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** tailored for education. Seamlessly integrate textbooks, lecture notes, assignments, and research papers into the chat experience.

  Enhance learning with real-time **web search integration**. Students and educators can perform targeted research using providers like `Google PSE`, `SearXNG`, `Brave`, `DuckDuckGo`, and more—right from the chat. The search results are automatically injected into the conversation, enabling **fact-checking**, **discovery of up-to-date information**, and **exploration of external academic resources** without leaving the tutoring environment.

- 🌐 **Web Browsing Capability**: Seamlessly integrate websites into your chat experience using the `#` command followed by a URL. This feature allows you to incorporate web content directly into your conversations, enhancing the richness and depth of your interactions.

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure secure access with restricted permissions; only authorized individuals can access your Ollama, and exclusive model creation/pulling rights are reserved for administrators.
