### A Note from Our Founder  

Before diving into our mission, we invite you to read our founder's blog post: ["Why I’m Building Open TutorAI"](https://opentutorai.com). In this post, Tim shares the inspiration, challenges, and hopes driving Open TutorAI's vision forward. It's a heartfelt introduction to what we're all about!

Hello there! 👋

Imagine a world where local, open models that can run on any machine, united as one, outperform proprietary giants like GPT-4. Even better, imagine us all having the capability to train and reproduce state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 or GPT-5 from scratch, using high-quality, curated data.

Here's the thing, though: one of the biggest challenges in creating these foundation and fine-tune models is the substantial need for **[high-quality data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206)**, which is both costly and time-consuming to gather and curate. This is where Open TutorAI's mission comes into play. Our mission is to contribute to this vision by building the best AI interface and crowdsourcing curated datasets from our community of users.

Our mission is founded on the belief that AI technologies hold transformative potential for society, yet their benefits have been narrowly confined due to complex setup requirements. Recognizing this, we are dedicated to democratizing AI by developing an 

### Our Vision: Shaping the Future Together

At the heart of our mission lies a profound commitment not just to envision a future where advanced AI technology is universally accessible, but to actively build towards it. Our efforts extend beyond the development of our TutorAI; We are at the forefront of creating an ecosystem that embodies the democratization of AI technology. This ecosystem, envisioned as a vibrant, community-driven platform, will be a repository of shared knowledge—ranging from model presets and custom prompts to valuable chat logs. 

Our strategy aims to tackle the complex challenges of AI, 

As we navigate this journey, our vision serves as our north star, guiding our efforts to turn bold ambitions into reality. We extend an invitation for you to join us in this endeavor, as we work diligently to ensure AI technology becomes an empowering resource for individuals and communities across the globe.
